public class Deck {
    // not sure if i need this (DECK) but i can put shared methods for both games here like shuffle and remove cards after they have been used to deal
    // for the remove card after using it in a deal (so you cant have 2 ace of spades) maybe implement a interface with a filter to check for duplicates.
    // the above might not be needed.
