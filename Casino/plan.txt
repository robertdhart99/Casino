log in as a person - save info from file 
 pass is hashed - 
database? 
person class has user name  - money -
	AI_person_BlackJack extends Person and has username (COM) money is -1 or infinint or something
	player has username = password(hashed) - money - time played - Skill level - Prizes( if they have a prize they can change the gui colors)
	Poker will have multiple AI_players_Poker with - username - money - Skill level 
set skill level in gui- drop down menu 
exit - which saves everything and writes to file - 
can play black jack or poker 
 if out of money - you can buy back in 

all in a gui
